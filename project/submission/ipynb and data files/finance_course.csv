0,https://www.classcentral.com/course/matlab-3396,"This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience. It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.

Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.

Students taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right.

The MATLAB Environment
    -We will learn how to start MATLAB and will familiarize ourselves with its user interface. We will learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. We will learn about syntax and semantics. We will see ways in which MATLAB provides help. Finally, we will learn how to create plots in MATLAB.

Matrices and Operators
    -The basic unit with which we work in MATLAB is the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. We will learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. We will learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and we will learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. Finally, we will learn MATLAB’s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression.

Functions
    -Functions let us break up complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. We will learn how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs. We will learn how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a well defined interface through which it communicates with that outside world. We will learn how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done.

Programmer's Toolbox
    -MATLAB has useful built-in functions and we will explore many of them in this section. We will learn about polymorphism and how MATLAB exploits it to change a function's behavior on the basis of the number and type of its inputs. Because random numbers play an important role in computer programming, we will learn how to use the MATLAB random number generator. We will learn how to get input from the keyboard, how to print to the Command Window, and how to plot graphs in a Figure window. Finally, we will learn how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger.

Selection
    -Selection is the means by which MATLAB makes decisions about the order in which it executes its statements. We will learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection. We will learn how to use relational operators and logical operators. We will learn how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error.

Loops
    -Loops give computers their power. We will learn how to use both of MATLAB's loop constructs: the for-loop and the while-loop. We will learn how the break-statement works, and we will use nested loops. We will learn how to make loops more efficient. We will learn about logical indexing and will see how to use it to produce implicit loops that are efficient and easy for a user to understand.

Data Types
    -Computers operate on bits, but humans think in terms of numbers, words, and other types of data. Like any good language, MATLAB organizes bits into convenient data types. We will study those types in this section. We will learn that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another. We will learn much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers. We will learn how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells, and we will learn how to store points in time and time durations.

File Input/Output
    -Files are named areas in permanent memory for storing data that can be used as input or output to MATLAB and to other programs. We will be introduced to MATLAB’s most important methods for reading and writing files. We will learn how to create, read from, and write into MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files. We will learn how to navigate among folders with MATLAB commands."

3,https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-fintech-ethics-and-risks-11392,"FinTech has started a global revolution in the financial services industry, and the transformation will only increase in coming years. There are many ways in which FinTech can improve the lives of people around the world; however, those same technologies can also be used to enslave, coerce, track, and control people. Accordingly, it is appropriate and necessary to consider the implications of the introduction of these technologies so that they are utilized properly, regulated sufficiently, and their adoption does not come at the expense of societal growth. 
This 6-week online coursecovers 6 modules, representing the full spectrum of finance, technology, and the introduction of FinTech solutions globally. We will ask questions that are not often asked or addressed when new technologies are adopted. Why should we adopt FinTech solutions, and what are the best ways to introduce disruptive technologies? How does blockchain technology change the way we provide financial services, and how should blockchain technology be governed? Is FinTech creating risks in cybersecurity and how can technology help us prevent financial crimes? As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and adopted, will human biases and prejudices be built into such mechanisms? And at a larger scope, should FinTech lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance, or will existing institutions adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets? 
Through discussing and attempting to answer these questions, you will understand better how the introduction of these technologies can benefit or harm society. And through considering the proper application or introduction of such technologies, you will learn to make better decisions as an individual and organization when facing the question: is FinTech our savior or a villain?

Introduction: Ethics of Finance and Emerging Technologies 
This module will provide a historical and broad perspective of ethical issues relating to finance and the introduction or adoption of emerging technologies. 
Blockchain and its Governance
This module will expand off the Introduction to FinTech course (https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-fintech), to consider the most relevant and ethical ways such technology should be implemented, in a number of different industries or product segmentation. In particular, data collection, customer privacy, and transactional issues will be covered in this module. 
Cybersecurity & Crimes 
FinTech can make it easier and cheaper for banks to monitor and control financial transactions, thus reducing fraud and reducing bank costs. But at the same time, these tools can be used to steal money and other corporate secrets, hide illegality (including purchases of weapons, drugs, etc.), and finance terrorists and other criminal organizations. Accordingly, this module will consider the implications of such important issues. 
AI & FinTech 
In this module we will consider the implications of building our own concepts of “human” morality into amoral machines, as well as a consideration of whether human biases and prejudices can or will be built into such mechanisms, whether purposefully or unintentionally. 
Institutionalization vs. Decentralization 
One of the key reasons people are calling for FinTech is for its decentralized nature, thus democratizing finance, and allowing regular people to participate more fully and affordably in financial transactions through technologies like cryptocurrencies, non-government issued IDs, and P2P lending. In this module we will address some large questions, considering whether FinTech should lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance. Or whether existing institutions will adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets. 
Big Questions Relating to the Introduction of FinTech 
In this final module, we will consider some of the many outstanding questions and purposes of introducing FinTech to the world, exploring the many ways that FinTech can both help and hurt society. We will discuss financial inclusion, sustainable development, and many other positive aspects of FinTech development. Conversely, we will also consider how these same technologies and solutions could potentially be used to inhibit access to financial markets, or worse."

Videos of the lectures, associated reading materials, and assignments will all be available here. There will be 20 videos, some with a speaker or two and some with a small panel. It’ll be 1,000 minutes of content if you watch it all.
We’ll cover how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more.
You can’t teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising amount. We’ve tried to take some of the best speakers from the past 9 years of Y Combinator dinners and arrange them in a way that will hopefully make sense.
We’re doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone. It will hopefully be valuable even for people who don’t want to start startups.
Talks like these have really helped Y Combinator founders create their companies. We hope you find it helpful too!

Closing Thoughts and Later-Stage Advice"
10,https://www.classcentral.com/course/stanford-openedx-convex-optimization-1577,"This course concentrates on recognizing and solving convex optimization problems that arise in applications. The syllabus includes: convex sets, functions, and optimization problems; basics of convex analysis; least-squares, linear and quadratic programs, semidefinite programming, minimax, extremal volume, and other problems; optimality conditions, duality theory, theorems of alternative, and applications; interior-point methods; applications to signal processing, statistics and machine learning, control and mechanical engineering, digital and analog circuit design, and finance.
PREREQUISITES
You should have good knowledge of linear algebra and exposure to probability. Exposure to numerical computing, optimization, and application fields is helpful but not required; the applications will be kept basic and simple. You will use matlab and CVX to write simple scripts, so some basic familiarity with matlab is helpful. We will provide some basic Matlab tutorials."
11,https://www.classcentral.com/course/ml-regression-4289,"Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices

In our first case study, predicting house prices, you will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.  Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.

In this course, you will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection.  You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, you will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.

Learning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:
   -Describe the input and output of a regression model.
   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
   -Tune parameters with cross validation.
   -Analyze the performance of the model.
   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
   -Deploy methods to select between models.
   -Exploit the model to form predictions. 
   -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
   -Implement these techniques in Python.

          Welcome
    -Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there.  It allows you to make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed, continuous-valued response.  Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene regulatory networks.This introduction to the course provides you with an overview of the topics we will cover and the background knowledge and resources we assume you have.

Simple Linear Regression
    -Our course starts from the most basic regression model: Just fitting a line to data.  This simple model for forming predictions from a single, univariate feature of the data is appropriately called ""simple linear regression"". In this module, we describe the high-level regression task and then specialize these concepts to the simple linear regression case. You will learn how to formulate a simple regression model and fit the model to data using both a closed-form solution as well as an iterative optimization algorithm called gradient descent.  Based on this fitted function, you will interpret the estimated model parameters and form predictions.  You will also analyze the sensitivity of your fit to outlying observations. You will examine all of these concepts in the context of a case study of predicting house prices from the square feet of the house.

Multiple Regression
    -The next step in moving beyond simple linear regression is to consider ""multiple regression"" where multiple features of the data are used to form predictions.   More specifically, in this module, you will learn how to build models of more complex relationship between a single variable (e.g., 'square feet') and the observed response (like 'house sales price').  This includes things like fitting a polynomial to your data, or capturing seasonal changes in the response value.  You will also learn how to incorporate multiple input variables (e.g., 'square feet', '# bedrooms', '# bathrooms').  You will then be able to describe how all of these models can still be cast within the linear regression framework, but now using multiple ""features"".   Within this multiple regression framework, you will fit models to data, interpret estimated coefficients, and form predictions. Here, you will also implement a gradient descent algorithm for fitting a multiple regression model.

Assessing Performance
    -Having learned about linear regression models and algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models, you are now ready to assess how well your considered method should perform in predicting new data.  You are also ready to select amongst possible models to choose the best performing.   This module is all about these important topics of model selection and assessment.  You will examine both theoretical and practical aspects of such analyses. You will first explore the concept of measuring the ""loss"" of your predictions, and use this to define training, test, and generalization error.  For these measures of error, you will analyze how they vary with model complexity and how they might be utilized to form a valid assessment of predictive performance.  This leads directly to an important conversation about the bias-variance tradeoff, which is fundamental to machine learning.  Finally, you will devise a method to first select amongst models and then assess the performance of the selected model. The concepts described in this module are key to all machine learning problems, well-beyond the regression setting addressed in this course.

Ridge Regression
    -You have examined how the performance of a model varies with increasing model complexity, and can describe the potential pitfall of complex models becoming overfit to the training data.   In this module, you will explore a very simple, but extremely effective technique for automatically coping with this issue.  This method is called ""ridge regression"".  You start out with a complex model, but now fit the model in a manner that not only incorporates a measure of fit to the training data, but also a term that biases the solution away from overfitted functions.  To this end, you will explore symptoms of overfitted functions and use this to define a quantitative measure to use in your revised optimization objective.  You will derive both a closed-form and gradient descent algorithm for fitting the ridge regression objective; these forms are small modifications from the original algorithms you derived for multiple regression.  To select the strength of the bias away from overfitting, you will explore a general-purpose method called ""cross validation"". You will implement both cross-validation and gradient descent to fit a ridge regression model and select the regularization constant.

Feature Selection & Lasso
    -A fundamental machine learning task is to select amongst a set of features to include in a model.  In this module, you will explore this idea in the context of multiple regression, and describe how such feature selection is important for both interpretability and efficiency of forming predictions.  To start, you will examine methods that search over an enumeration of models including different subsets of features.  You will analyze both exhaustive search and greedy algorithms.  Then, instead of an explicit enumeration, we turn to Lasso regression, which implicitly performs feature selection in a manner akin to ridge regression: A complex model is fit based on a measure of fit to the training data plus a measure of overfitting different than that used in ridge.  This lasso method has had impact in numerous applied domains, and the ideas behind the method have fundamentally changed machine learning and statistics. You will also implement a coordinate descent algorithm for fitting a Lasso model. Coordinate descent is another, general, optimization technique, which is useful in many areas of machine learning. 

Nearest Neighbors & Kernel Regression
    -Up to this point, we have focused on methods that fit parametric functions---like polynomials and hyperplanes---to the entire dataset.  In this module, we instead turn our attention to a class of ""nonparametric"" methods.  These methods allow the complexity of the model to increase as more data are observed, and result in fits that adapt locally to the observations.   We start by considering the simple and intuitive example of nonparametric methods, nearest neighbor regression: The prediction for a query point is based on the outputs of the most related observations in the training set.  This approach is extremely simple, but can provide excellent predictions, especially for large datasets. You will deploy algorithms to search for the nearest neighbors and form predictions based on the discovered neighbors.  Building on this idea, we turn to kernel regression.  Instead of forming predictions based on a small set of neighboring observations, kernel regression uses all observations in the dataset, but the impact of these observations on the predicted value is weighted by their similarity to the query point.  You will analyze the theoretical performance of these methods in the limit of infinite training data, and explore the scenarios in which these methods work well versus struggle.  You will also implement these techniques and observe their practical behavior.

Closing Remarks
    -In the conclusion of the course, we will recap what we have covered.  This represents both techniques specific to regression, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that will appear throughout the specialization.  We also briefly discuss some important regression techniques we did not cover in this course. We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization."

It explores the Constitution’s origins, its amendment over the years, and methods of constitutional interpretation. Topics include the nature and structure of the federal government, the powers of the federal government, and individual rights.
      


          The Constitution and Three Branches of Government
    -Classes 1, 2, and 3 discuss why we need a Constitution and the history that preceded its drafting. You will learn about the two conflicting lessons the founders learned from the Revolution and the failure of the Articles of Confederation: the national government can become a tyrant if it is too strong, but the nation will fall apart if it is too weak. These lectures explore how the drafters sought to balance these concerns in the original Constitution and the many compromises it contains. You will also learn about two approaches to interpreting the Constitution: Originalism and Living Constitutionalism. Classes 4, 5, and 6 explore the powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government and the separation of powers between those branches. The Framers gave the federal government limited powers, and divided those powers among the three branches in order to protect individual liberty and state authority. 

Amendments and the First Amendment
    -This segment first explores constitutional amendments, including the Bill of Rights, and the Reconstruction and Progressive-era Amendments. Then, we will take a detailed look at one of the most important amendments: the First. We will learn about the constitutional protections for speech and religion, how they have changed over time, and how they apply to various circumstances. Finally, we will learn about the Establishment Clause and what it means in today's society. 

Criminal Procedure and Federalism and Nationalism
    -We begin here by looking at another group of very important constitutional provisions: the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, which guarantee rights to individuals accused of committing crimes. These amendments protect us against unreasonable searches, ensure our right to remain silent in the face of police questioning, and allow us to demand the assistance of counsel and trial by jury. These rights are fundamental to our system of criminal justice.

Then we will shift our focus to examining the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and incorporation. We will also discuss the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, unenumerated rights, and states' rights, and finish by considering the implications of the Civil War and Reconstruction for the balance of power between the federal government and the states. 

The Fourteenth Amendment and Modern Controversies
    -The first three lessons consider the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment. We will begin by discussing race discrimination and the anti-classification and anti-subordination perspectives on equal protection. Next, we will discuss sex discrimination and the right to an abortion derived from the due process clause. Finally, we will examine discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the social progression of major civil rights movements in the United States. The final three lessons in this module consider some modern constitutional controversies. First, we will learn about presidential war powers. Next, we will analyze free speech in the context of campaign finance reform. Finally, we will discuss federal legislative power with a focus on health care reform."

In this course, we explore this tradition from its beginning with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers, through a number of notable historical and contemporary cases in which claims to rights and liberties have been at stake. We will examine issues of slavery, segregation, abortion, campaign finance, free speech, religion, affirmative action, and marriage.  Our discussion will be guided by thinkers like John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Friedrich Hayek, and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as important Supreme Court opinions, such as the majority and dissenting opinions in Dred Scott v. Sandford (on slavery), Brown v. Board of Education (on segregation), Roe v. Wade (on abortion), Citizens United v. FEC (on campaign finance and free speech), and Obergefell v. Hodges (on marriage).We do not seek unanimity of opinion, but rather a deepening of understanding. Whatever your views happen to be—liberal, conservative, whatever—they will be sympathetically explored but also challenged. The goal of the course is not to persuade you to think as anyone else does; rather, it is to encourage and empower you to think about disputed questions of civil rights and liberties more deeply, more critically, and for yourself.

22,https://www.classcentral.com/course/complexity-explorer-random-walks-11487,"The goal of this tutorial is to outline some elementary, but beautiful aspects of random walks.  Random walks are ubiquitous in nature.  They naturally arise in describing the motion of microscopic particles, such as bacteria or pollen grains, whose motion is governed by being buffeted by collisions with the molecules in a surrounding fluid.  Random walks also control many type of fluctuation phenomena that arise in finance.
The tutorial begins by presenting examples of random walks in nature and summarizing important classes of random walks.  We'll then give a quantitative discussion of basic properties of random walks.  We'll show that the root mean-square displacement of a random walk grows as the square-root of the elapsed time.  Next, we will determine the underlying probability distribution of a random walk.  In the long-time limit, this distribution is independent of almost all microscopic details of the random-walk motion.  This universality is embodied by the central-limit theorem.  In addition to presenting this theorem, we'll also discuss the anomalous features that arise when the very mild conditions that underlie the central-limit theorem are not satisfied.  Finally, we will show how to recover the diffusion equation as the continuum limit of the evolution equation for the probability distribution of a random walk.
We will then present some basic first-passage properties of random walks, which address the following simple question: does a random walk reach a specified point for the first time?  We will determine the first-passage properties in a finite interval; specifically, how long does it take for a random walk to leave an interval of length L, and what is the probability to leave either end of the interval as a function of the starting location.  Finally, we'll discus the application of first-passage ideas to reaction-rate theory, which defines how quickly diffusion-controlled chemical reactions can occur.

Course Overview In this module, you will become familiar with the course, your instructor, your classmates, and our learning environment. The orientation also helps you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Module 1: Investments Toolkit and Portfolio FormationIn Module 1, we will build the fundamentals of portfolio formation.  After providing a brief refresher of basic investment concepts (our toolkit), a summary of historical patterns of stock returns and government securities in the U.S. is provided.  We then consider general examples of portfolio choice to highlight the tradeoffs between “risk” and return.  We end the module with a discussion of dominated assets and efficient portfolio formation, emphasizing real-world examples and practice in Excel solving for the optimal portfolio given certain constraints (such as the amount of volatility we will accept in our portfolio). Module 2: Motivating, Explaining, & Implementing the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)In Module 2, we will develop the financial intuition that led to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), starting with the Separation Theorem of Investments.  We will understand that in a CAPM setting, only the market-wide risk of an asset is priced – securities with greater sensitivity to the market are required by investors to yield higher returns on average.  We will also learn how to interpret regressions that provide us with both a benchmark to use for a security given its risk (determined by its beta), as well as a risk-adjusted measure of the security’s performance (measured by its alpha).Module 3: Testing the CAPM, Multifactor Models, & Market EfficiencyIn Module 3, we will discuss different asset-pricing models, the pros and cons of each, and market efficiency.  In particular, we will test the effectiveness of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and examine survey data concerning its use by chief financial officers (CFOs) of firms.  Predictable patterns in stock returns, such as the size and value effects, will also be examined and the Fama-French 3-Factor Model will be introduced.  Market efficiency will be discussed in this module, as well as its implications for the asset-management industry and observed patterns in stock returns.Module 4: Investment Finance and Corporate Finance: Firm ValuationIn Module 4, we will learn about the two key approaches to valuing a company or stock: market multiples and discounted cash flow.  We will learn how to value perpetuities and will discuss how caution should be exercised in terms of projecting both the growth in long-term cash flows and the riskiness of those cash flows – two key components of the perpetuity formula.  To gain experience with the market multiples approach, we will estimate a value of Google at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) back in 2004 using market data on Yahoo! as a comparable firm.  Finally, the module closes with an assignment that will provide you with an opportunity to conduct a valuation of either Apple, Facebook, or Google.Course ConclusionIn this module, we say goodbye to the Investments course as key takeaways from the course are reviewed. A tease is also provided to topics that will be covered in Professor Weisbenner's second course on Investments."

- Manipulate the existing financial data by generating new variables using multiple columns

- Recall and apply the important statistical concepts (random variable, frequency, distribution, population and sample, confidence interval, linear regression, etc. ) into financial contexts

- Build a trading model using multiple linear regression model 

- Evaluate the performance of the trading model using different investment indicators

Jupyter Notebook environment is configured in the course platform for practicing python coding without installing any client applications.
      


          Visualizing and Munging Stock Data
    -Why do investment banks and consumer banks use Python to build quantitative models to predict returns and evaluate risks? What makes Python one of the most popular tools for financial analysis? You are going to learn basic python to import, manipulate and visualize stock data in this module. As Python is highly readable and simple enough, you can build one of the most popular trading models - Trend following strategy by the end of this module!

Random variables and distribution
    -In the previous module, we built a simple trading strategy base on Moving Average 10 and 50, which are ""random variables"" in statistics. In this module, we are going to explore basic concepts of random variables. By understanding the frequency and distribution of random variables, we extend further to the discussion of probability. In the later part of the module, we apply the probability concept in measuring the risk of investing a stock by looking at the distribution of log daily return using python. Learners are expected to have basic knowledge of probability before taking this module.

Sampling and Inference 
    -In financial analysis, we always infer the real mean return of stocks, or equity funds, based on the  historical data of a couple years. This situation is in line with a core part of statistics - Statistical Inference - which we also base on sample data to infer the population of a target variable.In this module, you are going to understand the basic concept of statistical inference such as population, samples and random sampling. In the second part of the module, we shall estimate the range of mean return of a stock using a concept called confidence interval, after we understand the distribution of sample mean.We will also testify the claim of investment return using another statistical concept - hypothesis testing.

Linear Regression Models for Financial Analysis
    -In this module, we will explore the most often used prediction method - linear regression. From learning the association of random variables to simple and multiple linear regression model, we finally come to the most interesting part of this course: we will build a model using multiple indices from the global markets and predict the price change of an ETF of S&P500.; In addition to building a stock trading model, it is also great fun to test the performance of your own models, which I will also show you how to evaluate them!"

And don’t be scared that the course will be “just a whole lot of mathematics”. Together, we will go beyond the math to learn how actuaries approach problems relating to risk, using examples from:

Finance
Investments
Banking
Insurance

You will learn how actuarial science applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in these industries and other professions.
You’ll experience “hands-on” learning using Excel (or an equivalent spreadsheet tool) to project and investigate the financial condition of a company choosing appropriate strategies for the company through the use of simulations.
The course has been carefully designed for students from a wide variety of backgrounds, with secondary/high school level being the only assumption of mathematical background. Even if you don’t have any background in, for example, calculus, the course has been designed so you can skip over these sections without affecting your understanding of the rest of the course. You also do not need to have any Excel or other spreadsheet background to take the course.
For those with stronger mathematical backgrounds, extension questions are provided to test you further. You’ll learn a huge amount about actuarial science no matter what your background is!

CTL.SC2x Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales & Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.
The main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:

Supply Chain Network Design
Supply Chain Finance
Supplier Management
Production and Demand Planning

Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, equity premium, and discount factor mean? This class is for you. We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth. In this part I, we’ll quickly learn or review time-series in continuous and discrete time. We'll look at some basic facts. Then we’ll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we’ll preview some classic issues in finance. That outlines the big ideas of the whole class. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. We will study the classic linear models — CAPM, APT, ICAPM. We will learn how to use GMM to estimate and evaluate asset pricing models, as well as the classic regression tests. This paves the way for Part 2 which focuses on applications and empirical evaluation. The math in real, academic, finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.

As a result, managing interest rate risks and its consequent impact on the riskiness and volatility of instruments traded in the money and debt markets have become exponentially more complex. This course will address the tools and techniques to manage the heightened level of interest rate risks. It will also look at derivative products such as futures, swaps and options and their role in not only helping institutions to hedge against those risks but also to speculate and make additional profits where possible.  This course is part of IIMBx's Professional Certificate program ‘Risk Management in Banking and Financial Markets’.

31,https://www.classcentral.com/course/money-banking-6632,"The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.

Three features of the new system are central.

Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  

Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. 

Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.
      


            Read more
          



          Introduction
    -The first two lectures paint a picture of the monetary system as the essential infrastructure of a decentralized market economy.   The second lecture, ""The Natural Hierarchy of Money"", is a kind of high-level overview of the entire course, so don't expect to fully understand it until you look back after completing the rest of the course.  Nevertheless it provides essential orientation for what comes after.  Lectures notes for these and subsequent lectures may be found in the very first segment of this module.  

Introduction, continued
    -The next two lectures are meant to introduce a key analytical tool, the balance sheet approach to monetary economics, that we will be using repeatedly throughout the course.  As inspiration, first I provide a concrete example of how the approach works by ""translating"" the Allyn Young reading into the balance sheet language.  I follow that with a more systematic introduction to this essential tool.

Banking as a Clearing System
    -In the next four lectures, we build intuition by viewing banking as a payments system, in which every participant faces a daily settlement constraint (a survival constraint).  From this point of view, the wholesale money market plays a key role by allowing banks to relax the discipline of a binding settlement constraint, delaying final payment by putting settlement off until a later date.   The relative importance of the various money markets has changed since the 2008 crisis--Fed Funds is now less important--but the conceptual framework remains valid, indeed not only for dollar money markets but also for non-dollar money markets.

Banking as a Clearing System, continued
    -The next two lectures extend the payments system frame to non-banks by bringing in repo markets, and to the international monetary system by bringing in Eurodollar markets.   Here, as in the previous two lectures, the emphasis is on settlement, and so implicitly on so-called ""funding liquidity"".  The last three segments of the Eurodollar lecture, on the failure of two seemingly obvious arbitrage conditions, are meant to motivate the shift to market-making and ""market liquidity"" in the next module.   

Banking as Market Making
    -""Market liquidity"" is supplied by dealers who stand ready to absorb temporary imbalances in supply and demand by taking the imbalance onto their own balance sheets, for a price.  From this point of view, banks can be considered a special kind of dealer, since they absorb imbalances in payment flows.   The first lecture is meant to build intuition by using our familiar balance sheet method to make sense of how this all worked in a system much simpler than our own.  The second lecture introduces a formal model of the economics of the dealer function, which we will be using throughout the rest of the course. 

Banking as Market Making, continued
    -Here we adapt the Treynor model to banks, which we conceptualize as dealers in money, specifically term funding.  Like Treynor's security dealers, banks supply market liquidity for a price.  But sometimes, in a financial crisis, demand for market liquidity overwhelms supply, and that's where the central bank comes in, as dealer of last resort in money markets.  And if the crisis is big enough, as 2007-2009, the central bank comes in as dealer of last resort in capital markets as well.

Midterm review and exam
    -The first twelve lectures have introduced all of the main concepts of the course.  The midterm exam gives you a chance to test whether you have mastered these concepts before extending them into new areas in the second part of the course.  But before you try the exam, first use the review lecture, and the questions from students, to review the main concepts.

International Money and Banking
    -The next four lectures extend the ""money view"" perspective to the larger world of multiple national monies by thinking about the international monetary system as a payment system, and by thinking of banks as market makers in foreign exchange.  The first lecture is introductory and conceptual, while the second builds intuition by ""translating"" Mundell's account of the development of the international monetary system into money view language (similar to what we did at the beginning of the course for Allyn Young's account of the development of the US monetary system).

International Money and Banking, continued
    -The next two lectures use the Treynor model to understand how exchange rates are determined in dealer markets.  In the second, we confront directly the puzzle we observed earlier in the course, namely why uncovered interest parity (UIP) fails to hold in real world markets.

Banking as Advance Clearing
    -The next four lectures extend the money view to the larger financial world of capital markets, where the price of risk is determined in dealer markets for swaps of various kinds.  The first lecture is a kind of conceptual introduction, while the second translates the standard finance account of forwards and futures into money view terms, as key building block for what comes after.

Banking as Advance Clearing, continued
    -In the modern economy, the price of risk is determined in swap markets that distinguish specific forms of risk, most importantly interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.  The Treynor model can be adapted to understand how the price of risk is formed in dealer markets.

  Money in the Real World
    -In this final module, we bring the entire course together.  These two lectures build on everything that came before, and show how all the pieces fit together into a unified whole.  Specifically, the first lecture uses the conceptual apparatus of the money view to make sense of shadow banking as the quintessential form of banking for the modern financially globalized world.  And the second lecture shows how the conceptual apparatus of the money view fits with standard economics view and finance view, by drawing attention to dimensions of the world from which the standard views abstract.

Final Exam
    -The previous module operated in effect as a review of the entire course, so if you were able to make sense of those lectures, you are ready for the final.  But maybe you first want to have a look back at the second lecture, ""The Natural Hierarchy of Money"", for a high-level summary of the essential concepts of the money view.  For almost everybody, the money view is a new and unfamiliar way of thinking about the world, and it takes a while to get used to it.  The purpose of this course is to plant the seed, by demonstrating the value of this way of thinking for making sense of real world problems.  Once you are done with the final exam, the real work begins, of using the money view to make sense of whatever real world problems confront you in your own daily life."

The Asia-Pacific region contains some of world’s most dynamic economies. Economies around the globe rely on credible monetary policy implemented by central banking institutions. Monetary policy governs the liquidity available to the payment systems that underlie trade and finance. Smooth adjustment of liquidity can minimize instability in money and foreign exchange markets and keep inflation and growth on a secure footing. The industrial giants of China, Japan, and Korea; the Southeast Asian emerging markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand; and the international entrepots at Hong Kong and Singapore each face unique challenges in implementing liquidity policy.

This advanced course will build a foundation for understanding liquidity policy implementation in the Asia-Pacific using standard economic models. The course will discuss the effects of high level discussion of a key element of national level public policy, monetary policy.  Modern monetary policy connects macroeconomic conditions and key financial market indicators. It will also analyze the way that central bank goals for macroeconomic stability will determine outcomes in interest rates and exchange rates. The rigorous theoretical foundation should also build analytical skills that might be applied to policy and market analysis in a broad range of economies and even in the Asia-Pacific region as policy-making evolves in the future.

The topics covered each week:

Module 1 - Monetary Policy Implementation
Module 2 - Monetary Policy Strategy
Module 3 - Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy

After taking this course and going through the interactive activities, you will be able to:

(1)  Describe Monetary Policy instruments central banks use
(2)  Interpret on-going actions of central banks
(3)  Apply graphical analysis and calculate basic economic measures used as tools by central banks or analysts

          Monetary Policy Implementation
    -Welcome to the first module!  This module will focus on the microeconomics of monetary policy implementation. We study how the central bank balances supply against demand in liquidity markets to target the key interest rate on interbank lending and influence money markets. 

Monetary Policy Strategy
    -Welcome to Module 2!  This module will focus on the macroeconomics of monetary policy strategy. We study the how (and why!) the central bank sets monetary policy in response to business cycle conditions in order to achieve a smooth and predictable inflation target. 

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rates
    -This module will focus on the various interactions between monetary policy and exchange rates. We study how monetary policy affects the balance of supply and demand in foreign exchange markets and policies required to stabilize the relative value of domestic currency

Bringing it all together

Spreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions. 
In Part 1, we shall be exploring multiple ways to describe these datasets, numerically as well as visually. Throughout, we shall embrace a problem-based approach to understanding the material: the primary reason to pick up a tool or a technique will be to solve a problem. Our course makes judicious use of tools.
In Part 2, we shall take up a few datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it impossible to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. The courses incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with both the mechanisms. Parts 3 and 4 are dedicated to Inferential Statistics. In Part 3, we begin by exploring the benefits of random sampling, and apply the Central Limit Theorem to arrive at confidence intervals for important population parameters. We also learn how to formulate hypotheses for business data, and resolve them with the testing framework that we establish. Along the way, we shall compare two or more populations and draw inferences with a set of statistical tests.

41,https://www.classcentral.com/course/meeting-investors-goals-5515,"In this course, you will dive into the concepts of rationality and irrationality and understand how they impact our investment decisions and what the consequences can be at the market level.

You will first explore the different biases that we, as humans, are subjected to when facing investment decisions and how they may impact the outcomes of these decisions. Moreover, you will see how emotions and ethical concerns such as honesty and trust influence market participants. When they are considered as a group rather than individually, you will discover how rationality and irrationality can drive asset prices to and away from their fair value. Finally, you will be presented with different portfolio construction methodologies and investment styles that make up the landscape of today's portfolio management industry. 

At key points throughout the course, you will benefit from the practical knowledge of experts from our corporate partner, UBS, in how to build and manage clients' portfolios.
      


          General Introduction and Key Concepts
    -In this introductory week, we will start by illustrating how emotions can hinder sensible investment decisions. You will then have the opportunity to check if you master the concepts of the first course that are important for this second course. Finally, we will lay the ground for next week’s content by looking at rational decision making.

How Individuals Make Financial Decisions
    -The focus of this second week is on you, the investor: what are the reasons you participate in financial markets? How do you make investment decisions? What can go wrong in your decision process and what are the consequences? What can you do about it? To answer these questions, we will talk about cognitive biases, emotions and moral values and their respective link with investment decisions.

Market Efficiency, Bubbles & Crises
    -In this third week, we will have a look at investors’ behavior as a group. How does it impact asset prices? How do these prices reflect available information? What does it imply for the profitability of some trading strategies? What can go wrong in this price formation process and how can (and did) it cause financial bubbles and crises? This week also features as special guest: Prof. Jean-Pierre Danthine, former vice-chairman of the Swiss National Bank, who will offer insights into some of these issues.

Portfolio Construction and Investment Styles
    -In this final week, we will look at two main portfolio construction methodologies: top-down and bottom-up. We will see how they differ but also how they can be combined. In the second lesson, we will review some important investment styles that are commonly used in the portfolio management industry. In this final lesson, you will also be given the opportunity to experiment with different trading strategies and compare your results with fellow learners."

46,https://www.classcentral.com/course/applications-calculus-5070,"Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include: 1) the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning; 2) a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus; 3) an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and 4) a clear, dynamic, unified approach.

In this fourth part--part four of five--we cover computing areas and volumes, other geometric applications, physical applications, and averages and mass.  We also introduce probability.
      


          Computing Areas and Volumes
    -Having seen some calculus before, you may recall some of the motivations for integrals arising from area computations. We will review those classical applications, while introducing the core idea of this module -- a differential element. By computing area and volume elements, we will see how to tackle tough geometry problems in a principled manner. 

Other Geometric Applications
    -There's more to geometry than just area and volume! In this module, we will take things ""to the next level"", ascending to higher dimensions. Coming back to the 3-d world, we will return to problems of length and area, but this time in the context of curves and surfaces. As always, the emphasis will be on how to construct the appropriate differential element for integrating. 

Physical Applications
    -There is so much more to applications of integrals than geometry! So many subjects, from physics to finance, have, at heart, the need for setting up and computing definite integrals. In this short but intense module, we will cover applications including work, force, torque, mass, and present & future value. 

Averages and Mass
    -There is a statistical aspect to integrals that has not yet been brought up in this course: integrals are ideal for computing averages. Motivated by physical problems of mass, centroid, and moments of inertia, we will cover applications of integrals to averages.  

An Introduction to Probability
    -This capstone module gives a very brief introduction to probability, using what we know about integrals and differential elements. Beginning with common-sense uniform probabilities, we move on to define probability density functions and the corresponding probability element. Building on the physical intuition obtained from centers of mass and moments of inertia, we offer a unique perspective on expectation, variance, and standard deviation."
47,https://www.classcentral.com/course/whartonfinance-625,"This course provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of finance, emphasizing their application to a wide variety of real-world situations spanning personal finance, corporate decision-making, and financial intermediation. Key concepts and applications include: time value of money, risk-return tradeoff, cost of capital, interest rates, retirement savings, mortgage financing, auto leasing, capital budgeting, asset valuation, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, net present value, internal rate of return, hurdle rate, payback period.
      


          Week 1: Time Value of Money
    -Welcome to Introduction to Corporate Finance! This first module will introduce you to one of the most important foundational concepts in Finance, the time value of money. Before diving into the Video lectures, I encourage you to take a look at the brief pre-reading for the course. Specifically, have a look at “Big Picture Course Motivation,” for additional motivation and context for the course, “Time Value of Money Overview,” for a motivation and context for our first topic, and “Quiz Problem Answer Input.” This last note is particularly important to avoid confusion with the problem sets. Then, go to the Video Lectures and start learning Finance!  

Week 2: Interest Rates
    -In this module, we wrap up the Time Value of Money topic with a discussion of inflation before moving on to our second topic, Interest Rates, and introducing our third topic, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with discounting and compounding arbitrary cash flow streams in order to value different claims and make better financial decisions. 

Week 3: Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
    -This module continues our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis by way of a capital budgeting case. (You might want to download or view the Excel file, “Tablet Case Spreadsheet.xlsx,” that I use in the lectures, but it is not necessary for understanding the material.) By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable valuing claims and making financing decisions in which the timing of the cash flows and compounding of interest is arbitrary (e.g., annual, semi-quarterly, monthly, etc.). Having worked through the problems, you should also be more comfortable with real world financial decision making related to retirement savings, home financing and refinancing, auto leases, and other scenarios. 

Week 4: Return on Investment
    -This module closes out our discussion of discounted cash flow analysis and caps off the course with a discussion of return on investment. By the end of this module, you should feel comfortable with the notion of free cash flow and the ability to apply a set of forecast drivers to project free cash flows into the future. These are some of the elements of a basic financial model, which we will use to come to a decision about the tablet project and to analyze the assumptions behind our valuation."

          Course Overview

Risk and Return
    -Welcome to Session 1 In this session we will discuss some basic but essential financial concepts such as mean return, volatility, and beta. We will also learn how to apply them in order to assess the performance of selected equity markets over the last decade. The learning objective is to understand the basic, essential, and widely used financial concepts.


Correlation and Diversification
    -To understand diversification, an issue at the very heart of most investment decisions, and the role that correlation plays in determining the gains from diversification.

The CAPM and the Cost of Capital
    -In this session we will discuss how companies assess their cost of debt, their cost of equity, and ultimately their cost of capital. We will also discuss why this last concept is at the heart of many of the most important corporate decisions.

Estimating the Cost of Capital - An Application
    -In this session we will put to work all the concepts discussed in the previous session by estimating the cost of capital of a company. As usual, when putting theory into practice, a few complications arise and we will discuss how to deal with them.

Project Evaluation
    -In this session we will discuss how companies routinely decide whether or not to invest in projects. We will discuss the two tools most widely used for this purpose, NPV and IRR, and apply them to the evaluation of an investment opportunity.

Corporate Value Creation
    -In this session we will discuss EVA, a tool widely used to assess whether a company is creating or destroying value. We will also put this tool into practice by estimating the EVA of two companies."
49,https://www.classcentral.com/course/financialengineering1-1014,"Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field drawing from finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and computational methods. The emphasis of FE & RM Part I will be on the use of simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with Emanuel Derman, the renowned ``quant'' and best-selling author of ""My Life as a Quant"". 

We hope that students who complete the course will begin to understand the ""rocket science"" behind financial engineering but perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism. The follow-on course FE & RM Part II will continue to develop derivatives pricing models but it will also focus on asset allocation and portfolio optimization as well as other applications of financial engineering such as real options, commodity and energy derivatives and algorithmic trading.
