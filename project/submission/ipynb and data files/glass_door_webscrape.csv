13,Altus Assessments,Data Scientist,"Our Purpose:

We want to create a world served by exceptional professionals, and we do that by helping academic institutions find holistically stronger applicants. We help them look beyond book smarts. Think of us like an “SAT” that evaluates who you are instead of what you know. Our main assessment, the CASPer test, is used widely for high stakes admissions to Healthcare Training, Teachers Education and other academic programs in Canada, the US and as far away as Australia. In 2019, we have assessed well over 100,000 applicants including 80% of all US and Canadian Medical School applicants.

Who We Are:

We are a group of ~50 individuals collaboratively working out of the OneEleven scale-up hub in the downtown core of Toronto. We tackle some tough problems (like how to evaluate empathy in someone who wants to become a doctor), and some less tough ones (like what to bring in for the communal snack table).

Our core values are caring, curious, and driven, and we embody these values in everything that we do. We genuinely care about the well-being of others, we possess an innate desire to continuously learn, and every day we strive to be better than the professional we were the day before.

Who Would Fit In:

People who do well here are caring, humble, prefer change over the status-quo, are comfortable with “fuzzy” (vs. well defined) tasks, and are eager to solve problems.

You have created data pipelines from a NoSQL database to analyze results for various stakeholders and proposed solutions and strategies to business challenges.
You have created dashboards to help with business intelligence and analytics for other teams within the company having identified, analyzed, and interpreted trends or patterns in complex data sets using statistical techniques, and presented information using data visualization techniques to provide ongoing reports.
You have helped build predictive models and machine-learning algorithms and automated tasks within the company to help deliver results and evolve our processes

51,Altus Assessments,Research Scientist,"Our Purpose

We want to create a world served by exceptional professionals, and we do that by helping academic institutions find holistically stronger applicants by looking beyond metrics of “book smart”. Think of us like an “SAT” that evaluates who you are instead of what you know. Our main assessment, the CASPer test, is used widely for high stakes admissions to Healthcare Training, Teachers Education, and other academic programs in Canada, the US, and as far away as Australia. As an example, in 2019 we will assess well over 100,000 applicants including 80% of all US and Canadian Medical School applicants.

Who We Are

We’re a quirky, vibrant, and diverse group of ~50 working out of the OneEleven scale-up hub in the downtown core of Toronto. We tackle some tough problems (like how to evaluate empathy in someone who wants to become a doctor), and some less tough ones (like what to bring in for the communal snack table).

Our core values are caring, curious, and driven; we embody these values in everything that we do. We genuinely care about the well-being of others, we possess an innate desire to continually learn, and every day we strive to be better than the person we were the day before.

Who Would Fit In

People who do well here are caring, humble, prefer change over the status-quo, are comfortable with “fuzzy” (vs well defined) tasks, and are ok with a daily helping of problem-solving. We all have a healthy appetite for learning and love to share our knowledge and teach our co-workers. We want people who put “we before me”. (You’ll learn more as you keep reading.)

The Role

Are you interested in engaging in diverse research programs in the field of assessment and admissions? We are looking for a research scientist to support our partners in their high calibre research projects and to lead independent research, building validity evidence for our work. You will have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on academic admissions across professions by helping us learn more about how CASPer helps our partners select better professionals while engaging in all stages of the research process.

In 12 Months

You are known to be able to juggle the workload of multiple simultaneous projects - using project management and tools to ensure project progress smoothly
You have earned the trust of your colleagues as being very reliable - if you say something is getting done, it gets done!

Michele and Andrew deeply understand the pains of building a business; Michele bootstrapped five companies, one which was acquired by Groupon, and sits on the other side of the table as a judge on “Dragon’s Den,” Canada’s equivalent of “Shark Tank.” Andrew, meanwhile, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for multiple startups and is an investor and advisor to many others.

They've seen the broken funding process from all sides, and the idea for Clearbanc was inspired by their own experiences and struggles building companies and working with other entrepreneurs.

Clearbanc has invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs, and has invested in 43 states in the US in 2019.

Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and Nvidia is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.”

113,Clearbanc,Senior Data Scientist,"Job Description
Clearbanc co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza knew there had to be a better way to fund your business than staking your house or sacrificing ownership of your company.

Michele and Andrew deeply understand the pains of building a business; Michele bootstrapped five companies, one which was acquired by Groupon, and sits on the other side of the table as a judge on “Dragon’s Den,” Canada’s equivalent of “Shark Tank.” Andrew, meanwhile, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for multiple startups and is an investor and advisor to many others.

They've seen the broken funding process from all sides, and the idea for Clearbanc was inspired by their own experiences and struggles building companies and working with other entrepreneurs.

Clearbanc has invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs, and has invested in 43 states in the US in 2019.

Why work with us?

We're a company built by founders for founders, and we’re laser-focused on our mission to help entrepreneurs succeed. You'll get the chance to work closely with people who have built, scaled and sold companies before.

While we're obsessed with our vision, we don't take ourselves too seriously. We don’t know all the answers, so we’re constantly experimenting and learning together.

Clearbanc is going through an exciting growth phase. We’ve just closed a $300M round and we're looking for the right people to join #TeamClearbanc. This is a unique opportunity for an ambitious person looking to make an impact while getting exposure to fintech and learning what it takes to build a successful startup.

Are comfortable reading, cleaning and transforming data for the experiments you run
Are aware of the perils of running myriads of A/B test
Are excited to add rigour to the existing process, while being comfortable with the idea of cutting corners from a purist's point of view
Technical Requirements:
STEM degree (BSc at a minimum, MSc/Ph.D. preferred)
3-5 years of professional, non-academic Data Science experience
Comfortable using SQL, or R/Python

Our team has developed a number of broad streams within our research program to discover and treat factors that impact smoking cessation, and the incumbent will have a strong familiarity and aptitude for working with technology solutions.

Other research streams within the NDS include projects in imaging, mechanisms of drug action, and novel treatment approaches, led by a quantitative scientist with expertise in clinical pharmacology; as well as projects in provider behavior change, knowledge synthesis, and knowledge translation, led by a qualitative scientist with expertise in developmental psychology.

The candidate will be encouraged to bring forward new research ideas to propose to and seek endorsement from the clinician-scientist; however, any new ideas must be aligned with the overall goal of our research program.

The candidate will also be expected to produce peer-reviewed publications to disseminate findings from their activities. In fulfilling these requirements, the candidate must adhere to all regulatory requirements for conducting research on human subjects in Canada and work collaboratively with research ethics boards and research quality assurance departments.

Candidates without a degree in Clinical Psychology but doctoral work in a related field will also be considered. Candidates will be required to have a minimum of two years of direct experience in clinical research while holding a leading role. The candidate should have experience with producing peer-reviewed publications to disseminate findings from their activities. The successful candidate must have demonstrated academic and work experience in working effectively within interdisciplinary teams as well as independently, and in completing studies or projects on time.

Michele and Andrew deeply understand the pains of building a business; Michele bootstrapped five companies, one which was acquired by Groupon, and sits on the other side of the table as a judge on Dragons Den, Canadas equivalent of Shark Tank. Andrew, meanwhile, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for multiple startups and is an investor and advisor to many others.

They've seen the broken funding process from all sides, and the idea for Clearbanc was inspired by their own experiences and struggles building companies and working with other entrepreneurs.

Clearbanc has invested in thousands of companies using data science to identify high-growth funding opportunities. This data-driven approach takes the bias out of decision making. Clearbanc has funded 8x more female founders than traditional VCs, and has invested in 43 states in the US in 2019.

Why work with us?

We're a company built by founders for founders, and were laser-focused on our mission to help entrepreneurs succeed. You'll get the chance to work closely with people who have built, scaled and sold companies before.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.

Here at BenchSci, these are our core values:
Focused: We focus on what will drive the greatest impact at all times.
Advancement: We believe in continuous growth, and discovering new ways to do things better. This applies to our product and business, but also to ourselves.

Tenacity: What we’re trying to do isn’t easy, but we hire the best people, and give them the autonomy, tools, and resources to succeed. The hard work is up to them.
Transparency: We believe that sharing diverse ideas and information creates strong teams. Our success stems from research, collaboration, feedback, and trust.

470,Manulife,ETL Migration Data Engineer,"Are you looking for unlimited opportunities to develop and succeed? With work that challenges and makes a difference, within a flexible and supportive environment, we can help our customers achieve their dreams and aspirations.

Job Description

We’re looking for someone who knows data: big data (but not necessarily “Big Data”), little data, clean data, messy data and all sorts of data in between. You’ve seen a little bit of everything and you enjoy working with it.

This is not purely an analytics role. We’re primarily for someone with experience analyzing and modeling data, moving it around, tidying it up and pulling it all together so that people can make use of it. We have data spread all over the place and in all sorts of different formats, and we want you to help us do something about that.

Maybe you’ve worked as a Database Architect, a DBA, a Developer or an ETL Designer. In fact, bonus points to you if you’re able to check off more than one of those boxes. What’s most important, though, is that you’re willing and able to help us design, implement, improve and support data migration and reconciliation systems that move and transform data from source to destination systems and validate its quality. Come help us evolve in a data-driven powerhouse!

What Will I Be Doing?
Help develop a system that migrates data from legacy sources to new ones
Review and enhance or replace a system to reconcile the migrated data to its source
Become a key part of the life cycle of our data
Become a Manulife data expert; you will know where our data is, how it moves around and who is using it
Assist with (and eventually lead) the design, development and implementation of new data processes, models and flows
Work with business partners and subject matter experts to understand the context of our data; not just how it’s structured, but how real people use it (or should not use it) to make informed decisions
Become more familiar than anyone with the sorts of headaches the users of our data may have and brainstorm solutions to help make their lives better
Get involved in many different things: today you might be doing some quick coding to generate a bunch of sample data, tomorrow you might be building data migration routines in Hadoop, building stored procedures for an SQL Server database, participating in a Proof of Technology session or locked in a room with a small team tasked with solving an issue that’s just flared up
Does that sound a little vague? Good, because life is a little vague and so are the best jobs. We can’t guarantee you’ll be using a specific set of tools or techniques day to day because this isn’t that kind of job. You’ll need to be self-motivated, resilient and comfortable with uncertainty. You’ll have to learn on your feet from time to time, and occasionally even teach others as you’re learning. No one is going to ask you to be an expert in something you’ve never done before, but you’ll need to be the kind of person who gets excited about becoming an expert in something they’ve never done before. Show us what you’re capable of and learn a lot along the way!

Qualifications

This isn’t a junior role, so we’re looking for someone with at least 3-5 years of related work experience. You should have specific experience in some of these areas and the willingness to be trained (and to some extent train yourself) in any areas you’re lacking:
Databases: designing/modeling, administering, writing complex queries/stored procedures – ideally using Oracle and/or SQL Server
Coding/scripting (not necessarily as a Developer) – SQL, Java, C#, Python
ETL/ELT/Data integration – Hadoop, Syncsort DMXh, Hive, Kafka
Various SLDC methods (i.e. agile, iterative, waterfall, etc.)
Bonus points for any experience with: DevOps or Continuous Delivery tools and processes, cloud (IaaS/PaaS), data profiling and analysis, and/or Hortonworks Data Platform / DataFlow.

Am I Right for the Job?

We're looking for a passionate, motivated individual to join our team. Experience with any or all the tools and technologies mentioned is a huge plus, but don't let one or more of those list items deter you! If you're excited by this posting, we want to hear from you!

What about Perks?

Manulife has lots of perks including, but not limited to:
Competitive compensation
Retirement Savings Accounts including a RPP (Pension Plan), RRSP (Retirement Savings Plan), and TFSA (Tax Free Savings account)
Manulife Share Ownership Program with employer matching
Customizable Benefits Package including Health, Dental, Vision, and 100% of Mental Health expenses
Financial support for ongoing training, learning, and education
Monthly Innovation Days (Hackathons)
Wearing jeans to work every day
An abundance of career paths and opportunities to advance
A flexible work environment with flex hours, work from home arrangements, distributed teams, and condensed work week arrangements
