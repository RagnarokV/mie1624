This course will provide students with the concepts and mechanics of the Blockchain technologies starting from Bitcoin. Unlike ECE1770, this course is not focused on middleware software design per se, but on how the Blockchain middleware can serve as a platform that supports products (cryptocurrencies) and applications that are relevant for businesses and other users. The course will focus on identifying business relevant benchmarking criteria for Blockchain technologies in accordance with their current and future impact on business processes. On a practical level, the course will enable students to set up a Bitcoin account that follows rigorous safety protocols, so as to enable students to become familiar with this revolutionary technology. In summary, this course will enable the participant to acquire a concrete understanding of Blockchain technologies through the installation, operation and modification (by coding changes or the addition of pseudocode) of a simplified Bitcoin program in each student’s computer; become acquainted with the history and typology of Blockchain technologies; develop and apply a set of selection criteria for the evaluation of Blockchain strengths, weaknesses and risks; trace a likely path for the adoption of Blockchain technologies– beginning with the identification of processes where Blockchain ledgers lead to efficiencies, to the emergence of new business models and ending with the need for constraints/regulation, and learn how to setup, operate and trade a Bitcoin account"
6,APS,1051H,Portfolio Management Praxis Under Real Market Constraint,None,Sabatino Costanzo and Loren Trigo,"After an introductory review of the techniques most commonly used to evaluate investment portfolios and investment managers, this course will, through a combination of lectures, readings, short case studies and exercises, try to enable students: to understand the trading techniques of few important portfolio managers; to test, when applicable, simplified versions of these techniques on basic portfolios under real market constraints; to manage basic portfolios of Stocks & ETFs as well as basic derivatives portfolios of Credit & Debit Spreads using time-tested value, momentum and covered options algorithms; to manage the risk of an investment portfolio using market breadth- based algorithms; to learn the main techniques used to evaluate the historical performance of trading systems, and to create a general portfolio management strategy adapted to the risk and return requirements of the user by incorporating the principles learned in the course, which will be back- tested against historical data to objectively evaluate its performance. Ideally the participant will have some exposure to basic equity valuation methods, basic portfolio optimization methods and basic bond and derivative pricing methods (like the ones discussed in “Financial Engineering I & II”), even though we’ll cover these topics if required by the participants in order to make our course as self- contained as possible."
7,APS,1052H,A.I. in Finance,None,Sabatino Costanzo and Loren Trigo,"In this course we’ll give an overview of several applications of machine learning to stock market forecasting (including high frequency trading), beginning with regressions, two “shallow” machine learning models (Support Vector Machines and basic Neural Networks) and ending with a deep learning model (Long Short Term Memory Networks). Each model is discussed in detail as to what input variables and what architecture is used (rationale), how the model’s learning progress is evaluated and how machine learning scientists and stock market traders evaluate the model’s final performance, so that by the end of the course, the students should be able to identify the main features of a machine learning model for stock market forecasting and to evaluate if it is likely to be useful and if it is structured efficiently in terms of inputs and outputs.

The participant should be familiar with the foundations of statistics, the basics of logistic regressions (desirable) and basic linear algebra (desirable); however, since our course intends to be self-contained, we will provide a review of these concepts as needed. As all the examples of our course come from finance, some familiarity with the Capital Markets and the basic financial concepts is required. A basic knowledge of Python or some other programming language (MatLab, R) is needed, even though the objective of the course is not to learn how to program (shallow & deep) machine learning models from scratch, but rather, to understand how they work and to learn how to adapt them to the particular needs of the user and to optimize their application to stock market forecasting. The math. foundations of the basic machine learning models (regressions, neural networks & support vector machines) will be discussed and followed by a panoramic view of the inputs that are most likely to provide valuable information for stock market forecasting. Standard benchmarking methods used in the industry will be also covered. Subsequently, a number of basic –already programmed– models will be discussed in detail and their performance evaluated."
8,CHE,507H,Data-based Modelling for Prediction and Control,descriptive,,
9,CHE,1147H,Data Mining in Engineering,None,,"An exceptional ability to deal with data is the defining characteristic of an engineer. Data Mining is the branch of Informatics that refers to a wide variety of methods used to obtain information from data. It employs statistics where possible but dares to tackle problems beyond the capabilities of statistics. Data containing experimental error, qualitative as well as quantitative data and large quantities of data are all subjects suited to Data Mining methods. These methods have traditionally been used in non-engineering fields. However, there is now an acute need to apply them in engineering. Students will use commercially available software applied to engineering data of interest to them. Data can originate from research projects, from the Internet or even from computer simulations. 70% of the course mark is assignments and presentations. 30% is the final exam. An undergraduate course in statistics is a prerequisite."
10,CHE,1148H,Process Data Analytics,None,,"This course will begin with an elementary introduction to statistics and probability, and then go on to develop various regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction and advanced machine learning algorithms that are of interest to analyze and extract information from process data. Such supervised and unsupervised techniques are of great use in process industries that are awash with large amounts of data, that is gravely underutilized. Much of process data is in heterogeneous form as sensor data, alarm and event data, image data and process connectivity or topology data. These methods are labelled broadly as BIG data. However, big data needs efficient and informative analytical skills in machine learning, engineering insights, pattern recognition and more, all of which will be the main focus of this course. Here is shorter outline to indicate the main contents and objectives of this course."
